II. Description								

In this project the robot was split into a controller that was remote,
and the robot acted on site. A report is provided which details
some technicalities of this project

Note : Both the original model and split model are provided.

The controller, directed the robot by remotely sending x,y,z and yaw,pitch, roll
instructions for movement to which the robot would respond and provide feedback
of its position and angle.

Software in the loop simulation is performed in Linux and MATLAB.
X,Y co-ordinates are generated by a mouse for which the appropriate 
S-function has been generated.

To run ./app

To compile either run the script scripts/compile.sh or manually compile

Remember to adjust the ip values. 
The mouse file is hardcoded to be "/dev/input/mouse2"

Please change it in the header file.
Make sure you have root access.
or run sudo chmod -v 666 /dev/input/*

make sure that the command ran successfully.

If generating code, make sure all options are as per
the manual.

Sample time is 0.1

You can set UDP receive in host to say 100 instead of inf and MATLAB
will not freeze. You will be able to switch it off.

Remember that you need to copy wrappers.

Possible error during simulink compilation is for the display block
Its nothing and should go away if you press the run button again

Make sure ports are free and not corrupted.
run netstat <portno> to check if anybody is using it.

III. System Requirements
1. MATLAB/SIMULINK with the Embedded Toolkit and Code Generator
2. A working Internet connection
3. Linux with the real-time library installed
